Integer Overflow

An Integer Overflow is the condition that occurs when the result of an
arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum size of the integer type used to
store it.


Buffer Overflow (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_Overflow)

A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. Writing outside the bounds of a block of allocated memory can corrupt data, crash the program, or cause the execution of malicious code
